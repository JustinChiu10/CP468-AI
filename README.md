#Firstly, download the dataset that contains the facial expressions from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apollo2506/facial-recognition-dataset. The first block of code in the Python notebook will prompt the user to upload a file, please upload the zip file downloaded which should be named “archive.zip”. From here, run all subsequent blocks of code excluding the fully commented out blocks, and the blocks of code at the end which contain models that yielded worse results. These models are found underneath a header that appears after all models have been trained.
